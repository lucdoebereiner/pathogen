    """*Pathogen* is a generative web-based electroacoustic composition that
makes use of a clonal selection algorithm from the field of
immunocomputing. The piece can be understood as an audible artificial
immune system. It lets the listeners aesthetically experience
the dynamics of learning processes that are at the core of immune
systems and their scientific models. The variation of timbre and its musical development is the
emergent result of a biologically informed machine learning process.

The system is presented with one or more sonic pathogens that are
recorded by the listener. The system tries to adapt to the pathogens
by creating sonic antibodies that recreate certain aspects such as
timbre and pitch. However, the goal is not to resynthesize or imitate
the listener's sounds, but to couple the sound synthesis process to
the adaptation behavior in nonlinear ways, giving rise to varying
timbres and textures.

The creation of antibodies takes place in an iterative evolutionary
process. In each iteration new sonic cells are produced by copying and
mutating the previous generation of antibodies. The offspring is
compared to the pathogen and the ones that match the pathogen most
closely will produce more offspring thus creating an adaptive
process. The process terminates if the affinity has crossed a certain
threshold and a long-term memory cell will be formed, which is a sound
with a longer duration that will be played repeatedly, but is placed
more remotely in a virtual soundscape.

There are three types of antibodies:"""
